# Data Warehouse Tacklebox

The Tacklebox is a project that helps the field and customers to quickly get started on Databricks for Data Warehousing. It is aimed to supplement the existing documentation and resources with practical examples and utility/tools that they can leverage to increase their development velocity, establish best practices in the field and also standardise on some of the approaches we run tests and collect metrics.
