# Databricks Runtime EOS Monitor - Asset Bundle
Monitor and alert on DBR at or nearing end of service.

This bundle creates:
- A notebook-based refresh job (`DBR_Lookup_Table.ipynb`)
- A dashboard (`DBR Days Until End Of Service Dashboard.lvdash.json`) that will be created in your workspace on deploy
