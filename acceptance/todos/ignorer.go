// In the context of 'include' functionality, the Ignorer logic appears to be reversed:
// For patterns like 'foo/bar/' which intends to match directories only, we still need to traverse into the directory for potential file matches.
// Ignoring the directory entirely isn't an option, especially when dealing with patterns like 'foo/bar/*.go'.
// While this pattern doesn't target directories, it does match all Go files within them and ignoring directories not matching the pattern
// Will result in missing file matches.
// During the tree traversal process, we call 'IgnoreDirectory' on ".", "./foo", and "./foo/bar",
// all while applying the 'foo/bar/*.go' pattern. To handle this situation effectively, it requires to make the code more complex.
// This could mean generating various prefix patterns to facilitate the exclusion of directories from traversal.
// It's worth noting that, in this particular case, opting for a simpler logic results in a performance trade-off.
